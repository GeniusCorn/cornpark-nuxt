# Hi there, I am Corn Huang

and I work at CAUPD. I am passionate about modern front-end development.

I am proud to say that I have been with [EMNOTE](https://emnotegb.com/) since 2017, a pioneering company in emergency medicine education and research, where I now serve as Senior Vice President of Technology.
